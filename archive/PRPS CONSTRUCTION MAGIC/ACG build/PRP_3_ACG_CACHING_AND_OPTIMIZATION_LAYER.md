# PRP 3: ACG Caching & Optimization Layer

## Reference: ACG_FEATURE_MASTER_CONTEXT.md

---

### Objective
Design and implement a robust caching and optimization layer for the ACG engine to ensure high performance for both single-chart and batch requests. Integrate Redis (or in-memory) caching, optimize core calculations, and prepare for future scaling.

### Requirements
- **Caching:**
  - Integrate Redis (preferred) or in-memory caching for all ACG line calculations.
  - Cache results keyed by chart data, calculation parameters, and version.
  - Provide cache invalidation and versioning mechanisms.
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Profile and optimize all core calculation code (NumPy, Numba, vectorization, etc.).
  - Minimize redundant calculations and data transformations.
  - Support batch processing and parallelization where feasible.
- **API Integration:**
  - Ensure all API endpoints (see PRP 2) leverage the caching layer.
  - Expose cache status and performance metrics via API if needed.
- **Testing & Validation:**
  - Provide unit and integration tests for caching logic.
  - Benchmark performance before and after optimization.
  - Monitor cache hit/miss rates and latency.
- **Documentation:**
  - Document caching strategy, configuration, and usage.
  - Provide example cache keys and scenarios.

### Deliverables
- `acg_cache.py`: Caching logic and integration.
- Optimized core calculation code (as needed).
- Unit and integration tests in `backend/app/tests/core/acg/`.
- Performance benchmark scripts and results.
- Documentation of caching and optimization approach.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Caching is fully integrated and configurable.
- Performance meets or exceeds benchmarks.
- All endpoints use the caching layer where appropriate.
- Code is modular, well-documented, and ready for production.

### Validation Checklist
- Cache hit ratio >80% under steady-state workloads
- Benchmarks recorded pre/post optimization with target latencies met
- Redis/in-memory configuration documented and tested
- Prometheus metrics exposed: calculation_time, cache_hits, error_rate
- Integration tests simulate cache warm/cold paths
