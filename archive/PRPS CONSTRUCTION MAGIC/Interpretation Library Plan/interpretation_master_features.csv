It symbolizes raw, instinctual power, the shadow self, and the aspects of our being that have been rejected, exiled, or repressed due to societal, cultural, or familial conditioning. It is a point of fierce authenticity and primal creative force.","Psychologically, Lilith represents the confrontation with our deepest, most repressed instincts and desires.

It points to where we experience the most profound disruptions to our sense of control, forcing a visceral confrontation with our primal nature and the deepest wounds of rejection.","Like Mean Lilith, True Lilith is a modern astrological point. Its interpretation builds on the Mean Lilith archetype but emphasizes its more chaotic, erratic, and embodied nature.","True Lilith represents the psychological process of radical disruption and chaotic release.

Fixed Star,"Regulus",Star,"royal star, fame, power, success, leadership, courage, nobility, downfall through revenge, leo qualities, heart of the lion, kingship, authority, glory","Regulus is one of the four Royal Stars of Persia, known as the 'Heart of the Lion' in the constellation Leo. It has been associated with kingship, power, and glory throughout astrological history.","Regulus bestows qualities of courage, nobility, and high ambition. It brings success through bold action and independent decisions. It represents leadership potential, fame, and royal or elevated status. However, it carries a warning: success can be lost through revenge, pride, or violence.","Psychologically, Regulus connects to one's desire for recognition and power. It represents the archetypal king or queen within—the part of the psyche that seeks to rule, lead, and receive admiration. It can manifest as healthy pride or problematic arrogance, depending on how this energy is integrated.","In life expression, Regulus often manifests as a natural leadership ability, courage in facing challenges, and a tendency to attract attention or recognition. Those strongly influenced by Regulus may rise to positions of authority or achieve fame in their chosen field. They typically have a commanding presence and natural dignity.","At its highest spiritual level, Regulus represents enlightened leadership—the courage to stand in one's power while maintaining generosity of spirit and nobility of purpose. It symbolizes the heart-centered leader who rules with wisdom and compassion rather than ego or force.","In modern astrology, Regulus represents the capacity for leadership, fame, and success through courage and integrity. It shows where we may achieve recognition through bold action and independent vision. It warns against the dangers of pride and revenge.","In traditional astrology, Regulus was considered the most royal of fixed stars, associated with kings, rulers, and those of high status. It was of the nature of Mars and Jupiter, bringing success through bold action but carrying potential for dramatic downfall if its power was misused.","Regulus represents our relationship to power, leadership, and recognition. It shows where we seek to express our noble qualities, where we desire to shine and be recognized for our courage and strength of character. It indicates where pride may be both our strength and potential downfall.",,"Draft","References: Bernadette Brady, Vivian Robson, Diana K. Rosenberg"
