# PRP 5: Testing & Validation

## Goal
Build a comprehensive test suite, reference fixtures, and validation utilities to ensure correctness, performance, and cross-platform reliability.

## Deliverables
- backend/app/tests/ephemeris/ (test files, fixtures, utils)
- Reference fixtures exported from Immanuel
- Test utilities (assert_angle_close, assert_vec_close, load_fixture, etc.)
- CI workflow for lint, typecheck, and test

## Success Criteria
- 90%+ test coverage for all modules
- Reference parity with Immanuel outputs (â‰¤ 3" arc)
- All edge cases (DST, high lat, leap years) are tested
- CI passes on Windows and Linux

## Validation Steps
- Run all tests and CI
- Compare outputs to reference fixtures
- Review coverage and performance reports
