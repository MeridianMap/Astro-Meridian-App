# PRP 8: ACG Documentation & Example Scripts

## Reference: ACG_FEATURE_MASTER_CONTEXT.md

---

### Objective
Create comprehensive documentation and example scripts for the ACG engine. Ensure all features, endpoints, data models, and usage scenarios are clearly documented for both developers and end users.

### Requirements
- **Documentation:**
  - Document all modules, functions, classes, and API endpoints.
  - Provide detailed explanations of the metadata schema, conventions, and calculation methods.
  - Include setup, configuration, and deployment instructions.
  - Place all documentation in `Meridian Ephemeris Initial build PRPs/ACG prp/` and summary docs in `PRPs/ai_docs/` for critical external references.
- **Example Scripts:**
  - Provide example scripts for core calculations, API usage, batch processing, and animation.
  - Include input/output examples for all major features.
  - Scripts should be ready to run and well-commented.
- **Usage Scenarios:**
  - Document common and advanced usage scenarios (single chart, batch, animation, metadata queries, etc.).
  - Provide troubleshooting and FAQ sections.
- **Testing:**
  - Validate all example scripts and documentation for accuracy and completeness.
- **Maintenance:**
  - Establish a process for updating documentation and examples as features evolve.

### Deliverables
- Comprehensive documentation files in the ACG prp folder.
- Example scripts for all major features and endpoints.
- Summary docs in `PRPs/ai_docs/` as needed.
- Validated and tested example outputs.

### Acceptance Criteria
- All features, endpoints, and data models are fully documented.
- Example scripts are accurate, runnable, and well-commented.
- Documentation is clear, complete, and up to date.
- All docs and scripts reference the master context and comply with project standards.

### Validation Checklist
- API docs synced with OpenAPI and `PRPs/contracts/acg-api-contract.md`
- All example scripts run successfully end-to-end
- README sections match actual behavior and file paths
- Troubleshooting covers common errors and their fixes
- Documentation cross-links to master context and related PRPs
