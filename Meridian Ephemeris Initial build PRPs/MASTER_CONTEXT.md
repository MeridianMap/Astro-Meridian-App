## Project Vision
A modular, agentic, and test-validated ephemeris engine and API, inspired by Immanuel, delivering high-accuracy, standardized outputs for astrology, analytics, and AI integrations.

## Core Principles
- No hacks: Use correct Swiss Ephemeris APIs, no manual angle corrections
- Test-driven: Reference outputs, property-based, and integration tests
- Modular: Each concern in its own module, clear boundaries
- Configurable: Paths, caching, and settings are not hardcoded
- Extensible: Support for planets, asteroids, lunar points, fixed stars, custom points
- Cross-platform: Windows, Linux, Mac; tzdata and path quirks handled

## Project Structure
- Initiation phase: Environment, tools, and documentation
- Core engine: settings, const, cache, serialize, tools, charts
- API & service: FastAPI endpoints, schemas
- Testing: Fixtures, utilities, validation
- CI/CD: Lint, typecheck, test, deploy
