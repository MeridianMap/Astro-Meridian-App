  and house placement strongly influence how this merged energy manifests.

## Chart Patterns

### Aspect Pattern Example (T-Square)

```yaml
# aspect_patterns/t_square.yaml
id: "t_square"
name: "T-Square"
pattern_type: "aspect_pattern"
planets_required: 3
aspects_required: ["opposition", "square", "square"]
keywords: ["dynamic tension", "motivation", "challenge", "achievement", "drive"]
description: |
  A T-Square consists of two planets in opposition, with a third planet square to both.
  This creates a right-angled triangle in the chart, with the third planet (the apex)
  receiving the combined tension of the opposition.
interpretation: |
  The T-Square represents an area of significant challenge and dynamic tension in the chart.
  It creates a powerful drive to resolve the inherent conflict through action and achievement.
  The apex planet shows where and how this energy is expressed, while the empty leg
  (opposite the apex) indicates the direction of resolution and integration.
  
  People with prominent T-Squares often display determination, resilience, and the ability
  to overcome obstacles through persistent effort. The tension of this pattern provides
  motivation and energy for accomplishment, though it can also create stress and conflict
  until the energies are consciously directed.
```

### Chart Shape Example (Bucket)

```yaml
# chart_shapes/bucket.yaml
id: "bucket"
name: "Bucket"
pattern_type: "chart_shape"
definition_criteria: "All planets within 180Â° except one planet on the opposite side"
keywords: ["focused purpose", "channeling", "one-pointedness", "specialization", "mission"]
description: |
  The Bucket pattern (also called the Bucket with a Handle) occurs when all planets
  except one are grouped within half of the chart, with the singleton planet (the handle)
  on the opposite side. This creates a shape resembling a bucket with a handle.
interpretation: |
  With a Bucket shape, the handle planet becomes a focal point of tremendous significance.
  It represents a channel through which the energies of all other planets are directed
  and expressed. The handle planet often indicates a special mission, talent, or purpose
  that provides focus and direction for the entire personality.
  
  People with this pattern tend to have a sense of specific purpose or specialized talent.
  They may be highly focused on particular goals or areas of life represented by the handle
  planet and its house placement. The house and sign placement of the handle planet show
  where and how this focused energy is directed.
