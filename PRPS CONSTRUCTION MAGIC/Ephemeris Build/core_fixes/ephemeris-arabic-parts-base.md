# BASE PRP: Arabic Parts System Expansion

## Feature Goal
Expand the current minimal Arabic Parts system (Fortune + Spirit only) into a comprehensive hermetic lots system with traditional formulas, day/night variations, and professional-grade lot analysis capabilities.

## Deliverable
Complete Arabic Parts system with 15+ traditional lots, configurable formula systems, day/night variations, and comprehensive metadata including traditional sources and calculation confidence.

## Success Definition
- Implementation of complete Core + Optional lot sets from Hermetic tradition
- Professional-grade lot analysis matching traditional astrology standards
- Transparent formula system with traditional source attribution
- Configurable lot selection and calculation methods
- Performance maintained at <100ms total calculation time
