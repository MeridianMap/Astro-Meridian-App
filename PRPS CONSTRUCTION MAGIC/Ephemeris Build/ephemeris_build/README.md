## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
1. **Start with Priority 1 features** - Build foundation for professional astrology
2. **Implement in dependency order** - Aspects → Arabic Parts → Predictive Features
3. **Test comprehensively** - Each PRP includes >90% test coverage requirements
4. **Validate continuously** - Cross-reference against professional software
5. **Optimize throughout** - Performance monitoring from day one

### Quality Gates
Each PRP must pass:
- [ ] Mathematical accuracy validation
- [ ] Performance benchmark requirements
- [ ] Integration test suite
- [ ] Professional astrological validation
- [ ] Documentation completeness

### Risk Mitigation
- **Swiss Ephemeris Version Locking**: Prevent calculation drift

- **Performance Regression Testing**: Maintain SLA compliance
- **Graceful Degradation**: Partial responses on calculation failures

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- All calculations maintain astronomical precision standards
- Performance SLAs met in production environment
- >90% test coverage across all features
- Cache hit rates optimize response times

### Astrological Metrics
