# Meridian Ephemeris Core Fixes - PRPs

## Overview

This folder contains focused PRPs to fix critical issues identified in the authentic API samples review. Each PRP follows the rigorous standards outlined in the PRP build prompts and provides one-pass implementation success.

## Implementation Order (Critical Path)

### Phase 1: Critical Data Quality Fixes
These fixes address immediate data quality issues without breaking changes:

1. **[PRP-EPHEMERIS-001-RETROGRADE-INDICATORS.md](./PRP-EPHEMERIS-001-RETROGRADE-INDICATORS.md)** - *IMMEDIATE PRIORITY*
   - Add explicit `is_retrograde` and `motion_type` fields to API responses
   - Fix: Missing retrograde status despite existing calculation capability
   - Impact: Professional appearance, user-friendly data interpretation

2. **[PRP-EPHEMERIS-002-NOMENCLATURE-FIX.md](./PRP-EPHEMERIS-002-NOMENCLATURE-FIX.md)** - *HIGH PRIORITY*
   - Replace generic "Object 17", "Object 18" with proper asteroid names
   - Fix: Inconsistent planet/aspect naming throughout system
   - Impact: Professional accuracy, eliminate confusion

### Phase 2: Core Astrological Features
These add missing traditional astrological calculations:

3. **[PRP-EPHEMERIS-003-ARABIC-PARTS-SYSTEM.md](./PRP-EPHEMERIS-003-ARABIC-PARTS-SYSTEM.md)** - *MEDIUM PRIORITY*
   - Implement complete Arabic Parts calculation system
   - Fix: `arabic_parts: null` field with actual calculations
   - Impact: Traditional astrological analysis capability

4. **[PRP-EPHEMERIS-004-ESSENTIAL-DIGNITIES.md](./PRP-EPHEMERIS-004-ESSENTIAL-DIGNITIES.md)** - *MEDIUM PRIORITY*
   - Add planetary dignity/debility scoring system
   - Fix: Missing essential dignities analysis
   - Impact: Professional astrological interpretation support

## Technical Standards

### PRP Quality Requirements
Each PRP in this folder meets rigorous implementation standards:

- **"No Prior Knowledge" Test**: Complete context for unfamiliar AI agents
- **Specific File References**: Exact paths, line numbers, and modification patterns
- **Working Validation Commands**: Project-specific test commands that exist
- **Dependency Ordering**: Clear prerequisites and implementation sequence
- **Information Density**: Actionable details, not generic guidance

### Integration Points
All fixes integrate with existing Meridian architecture:

- **Swiss Ephemeris**: Maintains existing calculation patterns
- **Redis Caching**: Preserves performance optimization strategies
- **FastAPI Patterns**: Follows established API design conventions
- **Pydantic Models**: Consistent validation and serialization
- **Monitoring**: Maintains metrics and performance tracking

### Performance Standards
Each fix maintains CLAUDE.md compliance:

- **Response Times**: <100ms median maintained
- **Cache Integration**: >70% hit rates preserved
- **Test Coverage**: >90% for all modifications
- **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing API contracts
