# Meridian Interpretation System - Implementation PRPs

## Overview

This folder contains the complete set of Project Resource Plans (PRPs) for implementing the Meridian Astrological Interpretation Engine. Each PRP follows the rigorous standards outlined in the PRP build prompts and provides one-pass implementation guidance for AI agents.

## System Architecture

The Meridian Interpretation System integrates with the existing ephemeris backend to transform astronomical calculations into meaningful astrological content. The system consists of five core components, each with its own dedicated PRP.

## Implementation Order (Critical Path)

### Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure (Weeks 1-3)
1. **[PRP-055-EPHEMERIS-INTERPRETATION-INTEGRATION.md](./PRP-055-EPHEMERIS-INTERPRETATION-INTEGRATION.md)** - *CRITICAL FIRST*
   - Establishes data bridge between ephemeris and interpretation systems
   - Defines transformation protocols and caching strategies
   - Must be completed before other components

2. **[PRP-051-INTERPRETATION-DATABASE-ARCHITECTURE.md](./PRP-051-INTERPRETATION-DATABASE-ARCHITECTURE.md)** - *FOUNDATION*
   - PostgreSQL schema for interpretation content
   - Content versioning and management infrastructure
   - Performance optimization for ~464K words of content

### Phase 2: Core Processing (Weeks 4-6)
3. **[PRP-054-TEMPLATE-ENGINE-IMPLEMENTATION.md](./PRP-054-TEMPLATE-ENGINE-IMPLEMENTATION.md)** - *PROCESSING CORE*
   - Handlebars template integration with FastAPI
   - Context-aware content selection algorithms
   - Performance optimization for <100ms response times

4. **[PRP-052-INTERPRETATION-API-LAYER.md](./PRP-052-INTERPRETATION-API-LAYER.md)** - *API INTERFACE*
   - FastAPI endpoint implementation
   - Pydantic models for interpretation requests/responses
   - Authentication and rate limiting integration

### Phase 3: Content Management (Weeks 7-9)
5. **[PRP-053-CONTENT-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM.md](./PRP-053-CONTENT-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM.md)** - *CONTENT OPERATIONS*
   - Editorial workflow for interpretation content
   - Version control and approval processes
   - Multi-tradition content organization

## Integration Points with Existing Meridian System

### Swiss Ephemeris Integration
- All PRPs reference existing ephemeris calculation patterns
- Maintains compatibility with current caching system
- Leverages existing planetary position calculations

### Performance Standards (CLAUDE.md Compliance)
- <100ms median response times maintained
- Redis caching integration preserved
- Monitoring metrics integration continued
- >90% test coverage requirements enforced

### Architecture Alignment
- Follows existing `backend/app/core/` structure patterns
- Integrates with current FastAPI routing conventions
- Maintains Pydantic model standards
- Preserves existing error handling patterns

## Content Scope & Scale

### MVP Content (Priority 1)
- 10 Planets × 12 Signs = 120 combinations
- 10 Planets × 12 Houses = 120 combinations  
- Major aspects: 450+ planet-planet combinations
- **Total MVP**: ~60,000 words

### Extended Content (Priority 2)
- Minor aspects and specialized combinations
- Chart patterns and formations
- Dignity/debility interpretations
- **Total Extended**: ~200,000 words

### Advanced Content (Priority 3)
- Predictive interpretations (transits, progressions)
- Relationship astrology (synastry, composite)
- Specialized techniques (midpoints, Arabic parts)
- **Total Advanced**: ~200,000 words

## Technical Standards

### Calculation Accuracy
- Swiss Ephemeris integration mandatory
- Cross-validation against professional astrological software
- Precision standards maintained from existing ephemeris system

### Performance Benchmarks
- Full interpretation generation: <100ms (CLAUDE.md standard)
- Content template processing: <50ms
- Database queries: <20ms average
- Cache hit rate: >80% for common interpretations

### Quality Assurance
- Automated testing for all interpretation combinations
- Professional astrologer content review
- User feedback integration systems
- Continuous accuracy validation

## Implementation Dependencies

### External Libraries
- Handlebars/Mustache templating engine
- Advanced PostgreSQL JSON operations
- Content versioning libraries
- Text processing utilities

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing ephemeris calculation engine
- Current Redis caching infrastructure
- Monitoring and metrics systems
- FastAPI routing framework

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- API response times meet <100ms standard
- System handles 1000+ requests/minute
- 99.9% uptime maintained
- Error rates <1% under normal load

### Content Metrics
- Complete coverage of basic astrological combinations
- Multi-tradition support implemented
- User satisfaction ratings >4.5/5
- Content accuracy validated by professional astrologers

### Integration Metrics
- Seamless integration with existing ephemeris API
- No performance degradation of current system
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Monitoring integration successful

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Performance Impact**: Extensive caching and optimization
- **Integration Complexity**: Detailed interface contracts
- **Content Volume**: Automated testing and validation

### Content Risks
- **Quality Control**: Professional review processes
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Diverse reviewer panels
- **Accuracy Standards**: Cross-validation protocols

## Next Steps

1. **Review and approve all PRPs** - Technical and astrological accuracy validation
2. **Begin with PRP-055** - Establish ephemeris-interpretation bridge first
3. **Implement in strict order** - Dependencies must be respected
4. **Continuous testing** - Each PRP includes comprehensive test requirements
