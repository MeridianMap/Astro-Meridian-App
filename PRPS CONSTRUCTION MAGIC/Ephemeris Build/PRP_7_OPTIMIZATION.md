# PRP 7: Performance & Optimization

## Goal
Ensure the ephemeris backend is highly performant, scalable, and ready for production workloads.

## Deliverables
- NumPy/Numba vectorization for batch calculations
- Redis caching integration
- Docker Compose for local dev and CI
- Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards
- PyO3/Rust extension (optional, for critical paths)
- Benchmarking and profiling suite (pytest-benchmark, py-spy)

## Success Criteria
- Batch calculations are 10x faster than naive loops
- Cache hit rate >90% under load
- Monitoring dashboards show <100ms median response
- Profiling identifies and eliminates bottlenecks

## Validation Steps
- Run benchmarks and profiling tools
- Review Prometheus/Grafana dashboards
- Simulate load with k6 or similar
