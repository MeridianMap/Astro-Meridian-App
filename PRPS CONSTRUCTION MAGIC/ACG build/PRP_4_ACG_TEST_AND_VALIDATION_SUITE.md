# PRP 4: ACG Test & Validation Suite

## Reference: ACG_FEATURE_MASTER_CONTEXT.md

---

### Objective
Design and implement a comprehensive test and validation suite for the ACG engine, ensuring correctness, reliability, and cross-validation with reference projects. Achieve >90% test coverage and automated visual regression for all core features.

### Requirements
- **Test Coverage:**
  - Unit tests for all core calculation, API, and caching functions.
  - Integration tests for end-to-end workflows (input â†’ output).
  - Edge case and error handling tests.
- **Validation:**
  - Cross-validate output against Astrolog, Immanuel, and Flatlib for all supported line types and bodies.
  - Automated visual regression tests (compare output maps to reference images/datasets).
  - Validate metadata schema and GeoJSON output for all features.
- **Performance & Monitoring:**
  - Benchmark tests for calculation speed and API response times.
  - Monitor test coverage and performance metrics.
- **Test Data:**
  - Provide reference input charts and expected output files.
  - Include edge cases, rare configurations, and batch scenarios.
- **Automation:**
  - Integrate tests with CI/CD pipeline (if available).
  - Auto-generate test reports and coverage summaries.
- **Documentation:**
  - Document all test cases, validation procedures, and reference datasets.

### Deliverables
- Unit and integration tests in `backend/app/tests/core/acg/`.
- Reference input/output and image files.
- Test coverage and benchmark reports.
- Test and validation documentation.

### Acceptance Criteria
- >90% test coverage for all ACG code.
- Output validated against reference projects and datasets.
- Automated visual regression and performance benchmarks in place.
- All tests documented and reproducible.

### Validation Checklist
- `pytest -q` passes for all ACG tests with coverage >90%
- GeoJSON and metadata schema validation scripts pass
- Cross-validation diffs within tolerance against reference outputs
- Performance tests meet targets from master context
- Visual regression suite passes within defined thresholds
