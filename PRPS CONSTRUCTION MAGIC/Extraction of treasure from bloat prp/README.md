## üéØ KEY DISCOVERIES

### ‚úÖ PROFESSIONAL SYSTEMS CONFIRMED:
1. **Fixed Stars**: Complete Foundation 24 + Extended 77 implementation
2. **Arabic Parts**: All 16+ traditional lots with day/night sect awareness  
3. **Enhanced Aspects**: 15+ aspect types with variable orb systems
4. **ACG Engine**: Working MC/IC/AC/DC mathematical formulas
5. **Swiss Ephemeris**: Native integration patterns for all body types

### ‚ùå BLOAT SOURCE IDENTIFIED:
- **Service Layer**: Kitchen-sink response generation (9MB+ responses)
- **Metadata Inclusion**: Excessive calculation provenance data
- **Redundant Calculations**: Multiple paths to same data
- **NOT the feature implementations** - These are professional quality

### üöÄ OPTIMAL STRATEGY:
- **Surgical Extraction**: 3 weeks vs 8+ weeks rebuild
- **Preserve Professional Treasures**: Extract as-is
- **Optimize Service Layer**: Streamline integration and responses
- **Target**: <50KB responses, <100ms calculations
